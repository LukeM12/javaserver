This library is intended to be a starter for a much larger library that will
hold operations in packet sniffing, server/client setup, embing with javascript, and other general networking functions. 

It again is just the basic outline for a potential larger function so there will be some calls that seem as though they should not be there. i.e. print InetAddress.

Also, it takes on an approach to a debugging file. This could possibly have a debugging level, as well as reading the debugging file. 

And finally a goal is to have it written in C. Simply for the hell of it. 

Meaning that I want to use the JNI to emb it with C and have shared memory space. What purpose will this server? 
Because I want to.

Thank you
